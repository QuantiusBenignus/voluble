## Joplin notification example
#### A video demonstration of  creating a Joplin To-Do with an alarm that triggers a notification at 17:00 hours. Voluble then reads it outloud.
Please, note the extension icon in the top bar.
The appearing microphone icon indicates speech input (I am dictating the text into Joplin using [BlahST](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/BlahST).)
Please, use full screen mode to see the details:
